# SmartMedicineDispenser
##### This is a team project of ECE651 in University of Waterloo.

##### Note: 

1. Please install all of the relevant packages first, python interpreter version: 3.9
2. **login.db is only used for building login system, it is independent to any other parts**,  just put your parts into **enter_doctor_system** and **enter_patient_system**, please feel free to use your own methods to set up the database of your own parts.
3. Some fonts and color scheme of Mac and Win is not aligned. So I set up Win's version and Mac's version. If not develop two version, the good Mac version program would have a weird login page when it is running on Win.
