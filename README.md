##### This is a team project of ECE651 in University of Waterloo.

##### Note: 

1. Please first install all the relevant packages.(Python3.9)
2. **login.db is only used for building login system, it is not relevant to any other part**. Please put your parts into **enter_doctor_system** and **enter_patient_system**. Feel free to use your own methods to set up the database of your own parts ðŸ˜Š
3. You might have noticed that some fonts and color scheme in the two versions of macOS and Windows are not aligned. This is intentionally done for an aesthetic purpose. I set up these two versions in the consideration of the subtle differences between the two operating systems. Without the two versions, the original macOS version program would have a botched login page when it is running on Windows.
